# Method summary

First, we load in the functions, packages and data (running *data_proc.R* and *aneu_functions.R*).

```{r load_functions_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#load in functions

folder_location = paste0(here(), "/")
plot_folder = paste0(folder_location, "plots")
source(paste0(folder_location, "aneu_functions.R"))

# To process:
# source(paste0(folder_location, "data_proc.R"), echo = FALSE)

# To load:

  load(file)


#stop edgeR/scploid getCounts() issue
getCounts = scploid::getCounts

```

Summarising how our aneuploidy calling method works, we use CPM counts ($c_{gij}$) for gene $g$ on chromosome number $i$ in cell $j$, and normalise the count for each gene by its median value across cells:

$$ a_{gij} = \frac{c_{gij}}{\mbox{med}_{j} c_{gij}}$$

We then sum these expression scores over each individual chromosome:

$$b_{ij} = \sum_{g \in i} a_{gij}$$

Before controlling for the number of genes $G$ considered on each chromosome $i$, $G_i$:

$$r_{ij} = \frac{b_{ij}}{G_i}$$ 

We then centre each cell's median chromosome score on 1:

$$s_{ij} = 1 + (r_{ij} - \mbox{med}_{i} r_{ij})$$ 

This corrects for two features:

1. Monosomies and trisomies release and take up read space respectively in our CPM counts. They therefore increase/depress the summed scores of other chromosomes in the cell. By our assumption that the median scoring chromosome is of normal ploidy, this effect is abolished.

2. Low expression can score from $0<a_{gij}<1$, while high expression can score from $1<a_{gij}<\infty$. This leads to a slight bias where $mean_{j}(a_{gij}) > 1$.

Assuming that no chromosome within a cell has a copy number gain or loss, $s_{ij}$ will deviate randomly around 1. By contrast, if specific chromosomes possess evidence of an aneuploidy their scores will be elevated or reduced accordingly. Note that this interpretation assumes that:

* The median scoring chromosome in a cell must be of normal ploidy. If a majority of chromosomes in a cell show either a trisomy or monosomy, the cell centering step will consider those chromosomes as normal ploidy.

* For each chromosome across cells, its median-scoring chromosome must be normal ploidy. Otherwise, this majority will be median-centered and called as normal ploidy, and the remaining chromosomes will score aberrantly.

<br>

To infer whether a cell-chromosome displays aberrant copy number, we convert $s_{ij}$ into a Z-score, where the variance was computed separately for each chromosome across cells using the median absolute deviation (MAD), which protects against the variance-inflating influence of aneuploid scores. We identified aneuploid chromosomes using an FDR-corrected $p<0.1$, where the p-value was obtained using Student's t-distribution (d.f. $n_{cells}-1$).


This method is motivated by the presence of a whole-chromosome trisomy or monosomy showing systematic transcriptional up- or down-regulation across all of its genes, therefore affecting our chromosome scores relative to the median chromosome score in each cell grouping


We also have a few additional rules for calling aneuploidy to capture effects that the Z-score cannot easily capture:

1. We consider only highly expressed genes (CPM median > 50), as a small expression change for a lowly expressed gene can disproportionately impact the score via the median-normalised counts.

2. We look for substructure in our data using PCA on the highly expressed genes. If any structure is observed, we analyse the cells in each group separately.

3. A chromosome score ($s_{ij}$) must be large or small (>1.2 or <0.8) as well as statistically significant to be called as aneuploid. This prevents calling of aneuploidy in chromosomes whose scores deviate only slightly, but where the variance of the test statistic is small.


# Analysis on mouse 8-cell stage cells (G&T-seq)

A G&T seq dataset of 8-cell stage mouse embryos (published in [Macauley et al. 2015](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n6/full/nmeth.3370.html)) allows us to estimate ploidy from transcriptomes while also having access to the ground truth via parallel genomic sequencing. The concordance between these two sets of information was highlighted in Figure 2 (panel F) of that paper.

First we look for substructure in the data - we do not want our analysis of ploidy confounded by unrelated transcriptional differences, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:gnt-substruct)

```{r gnt-substruct, fig.cap="8-cell embryo PCA. PCA has been performed on the 8-cell stage embryo data using the genes considered for ploidy assessment (i.e. gene expression median CPM value > 50, log transformed). Colours label different cells."}
#pca on log(counts+1)

plotPCA(emb8, cols = emb8_meta$embryo)
```

The reversine treatment appears to drive transcriptional differences between cells - they split on PC1. Different embryos are well mixed, however. We should therefore analyse our cells in groups according to treatment status to avoid introducing systematic chromosome score differences that are driven by the treatment-response rather than any real aneuploidy.

We now call aneuploidies in the mouse embryos using our method and compare our results to known aneuploidies from genome sequencing. Performance metrics are shown in Table \@ref(tab:call-mouse). The metrics considered are:

* Sensitivity: fraction of real aneuploidies identified.

* Precision: fraction of correctly called aneuploidies of all called aneuploidies.

* Specificity: fraction of correctly called normal ploidy chromosomes.

* False discovery rate (FDR): fraction of incorrectly called aneuploidies of all called aneuploidies.

* Accuracy: fraction of all calls that are correct (aneuploidy and normal ploidy).

* F1: harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity.

* False positive rate (FPR): Fraction of normal ploidy chromosomes called as aneuploid.

```{r call-mouse}

emb8 = doAneu(emb8)

mouse_hits = getHits(emb8)

mouse_false_pos = getFP(emb8)

#get performance metrics
mouse_test = testPerformance(emb8)
kable(as.data.frame(t(format(mouse_test, digits = 3))), caption = "Method performance on G&T-seq 8-cell embryos")

```

Performance is excellent, capturing the vast majority of aneuploidies with a low rate of false calling. 

Using log-counts (and appropriately altered parameters e.g. CPM threshold) does not improve performance. Results are shown in Table \@ref(tab:log-counts)

```{r log-counts}

#to do this we hack the CPM values and median exclusion method
emb8_log = emb8
emb8_log@cpm = log10(getCounts(emb8_log)+1)
emb8_log = setParam(emb8_log, "min.median", log10(50))
emb8_log = doAneu(emb8_log)

log_test = testPerformance(emb8_log)

kable_tab = rbind(mouse_test, log_test)
rownames(kable_tab) = c("CPM", "Log-CPM")

kable(as.data.frame(kable_tab), caption = "Method performance on G&T-seq 8-cell embryos using log CPMs vs regular method application")

```

Removing the step of normalisation across chromosomes in each cell reduces sensitivity, shown in Table \@ref(tab:nonorm).

```{r nonorm}

emb8_nocenter = setParam(emb8, "center.cells", FALSE)
emb8_nocenter = doAneu(emb8_nocenter)

nonorm_test = testPerformance(emb8_nocenter)

kable_tab = rbind(mouse_test, nonorm_test)
rownames(kable_tab) = c("Cell normalised", "Not cell normalised")

kable(kable_tab, caption = "Method performance on G&T-seq 8-cell embryos, with and without normalising across chromosomes in a cell")

```

We will now investigate some of the assumptions of our model to ensure it is working as planned.

## Testing model assumptions

**Contribution of true aneuploidy status to our scores**
```{r r2_zscore}
# Get the z-scores, and note which chromosomes are truly aneuploid
z_gt = getScores(emb8)
z_gt$truth = FALSE
z_gt$truth[which(paste0(z_gt$cell, z_gt$chr)%in%paste0(getKnownAneu(emb8)$cell, getKnownAneu(emb8)$chr))] = TRUE
#what fraction of score variance is explained by the true presence of an aneuploidy?
z_mod = lm(abs(z_gt$z) ~ z_gt$truth)

```

For Z-scores of each chromosome $i$, $Z_i$, and ploidy status indicator $\phi_i$ ($\phi_i = 1 \text{ if aneuploid}$, $\phi_i = 0 \text{ if normal ploidy}$), we fit the linear model:

$$|Z_i| = \alpha + \beta \phi_i + \epsilon$$

using ordinary least squares.
This model explains over half of |Z|-score variance ($R^2 =$ `r format(summary(z_mod)$r.squared, digits = 3)`).

**Investigation of off-chromosome aneuploidy effects**

Because chromosomes present in "incorrect" copy number show abnormal levels of gene expression, the presence of aneuploid chromosomes may disregulate gene expression on other chromosomes from the same cell. This would confound our prediction of true ploidy status, as we may overpredict the degree of aneuploidy in aneuploid cells due to these off-chromosome effects. 

We can check for this by comparing the variance of aneuploidy scores ($S_{ij}$) across known normal ploidy chromosomes in cells with aneuploidies against variance across aneuploidy scores in cells without aneuploidy.  This is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:off-target-effects)

```{r off-target-effects, fig.cap="Empirical cumulative distribution functions for aneuploidy score variance. The ECDF is plotted for the variance across normal-ploidy chromosomes in each cell for cells that either contain an aneuploidy (grey) or that do not contain an aneuploidy (red). Chromosome scores of truly aneuploid chromosomes are excluded. These distributions investigate whether the presence of an aneuploid chromosome destabilises expression on other chromosomes such that those chromosomes may be incorrectly called as aneuploid."}
# first we need to scrub the aneuploid chromosomes
# our comparison is between the non-aneuploid ones
scrubbed_ratios = getSijMat(emb8)
known = getKnownAneu(emb8)
for(row in 1:nrow(known)){
    scrubbed_ratios[ as.character(known$chr[row]), 
                     as.character(known$cell[row]) ] = NA
}
#get variance cell-wise
vars = apply(scrubbed_ratios, 2, var, na.rm = T)
aneu_vars = vars[names(vars)%in%getKnownAneu(emb8)$cell]
non_aneu_vars = vars[!names(vars)%in%getKnownAneu(emb8)$cell]

var_test = ks.test(aneu_vars, non_aneu_vars)
wil_test = wilcox.test(aneu_vars, non_aneu_vars)

plot(ecdf(aneu_vars), verticals=TRUE, do.points=FALSE, col = "darkgrey", main = "Ploidy variance cumulative distributions", xlab = "Variance", ylab = "Cumulative distribution")
plot(ecdf(non_aneu_vars), verticals=TRUE, do.points=FALSE, add=TRUE, col='brown')
legend(x=0.012, y=0.4, fill = c("darkgrey", "brown"), legend = c("Aneuploid cell variance", "Non-aneuploid cell variance"))


```

The difference in variances of non-aneuploid chromosome scores is not significant (P=`r format(var_test$p.value, digits = 3)`, KS-test, see cumulative distribution plot above; P=`r format(wil_test$p.value, digits = 3)`, Mann-Whitney U test).

**Test for properly distributed Z-scores**

We have assumed that chromosome scores are normally distributed with MAD estimated variance, which should give us a set of Z-scores that are t-distributed ($df = n-1$, $n$ = group cell size). That this is true is important for our use of p-values to call aneuploidies.

To ensure this is the case, we investigate our observed distribution of normal-ploidy z-scores. We show them compared to the normal distribution (as the number of degrees of freedom is relatively high, at `r min(table(factor(emb8_meta$treatment)))`) in a Q-Q plot (Figure \@ref(fig:normality-test-qq)). p-values are also visually evenly distributed, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:normality-test-hist).

```{r normality-test-qq, fig.cap="Q-Q plot for non-aneuploid Z-scores. The Z-scores calculated from the non-aneuploid chromosomes in the 8-cell embryo data lie close to the diagonal in a normal Q-Q plot."}
normal_cells = z_gt[!z_gt$truth,]

# We have ties in the KS-test - hide the output that warns of this, as we cannot avoid it in our method (median centering)
ks_test =suppressWarnings( ks.test(normal_cells$z, pt, df = min(table(factor(emb8_meta$treatment)))))


qqnorm(normal_cells$z)
qqline(normal_cells$z)
```

```{r normality-test-hist, fig.cap="Evenly distributed p-values for non-aneuploid chromosomes. P-values calculated for non-aneuploid chromosomes are nearly evenly distributed. The peak at p=1 derives from the median-centering approach used in the method."}

hist(normal_cells$p, xlab = "Unadjusted p-values", main = "")

```

The Z scores sit well on the normal Q-Q plot. We can also see that the unadjusted p-values are distributed approximately uniformly (there is an inflation of p=1 values due to our median centering approach.)

The assumptions made in our method therefore appear valid.

## False predictions

**False negatives**

```{r missed_chr}
#collate the failures we make

missing = paste(getFN(emb8)$cell, getFN(emb8)$chr)
extra = paste(getFP(emb8)$cell, getFP(emb8)$chr)

#make them nice to print to the html output
missing = sapply(missing, function(x) paste(read.fwf(textConnection(x), c(2, nchar(x)), as.is = TRUE), collapse = " chr"))

extra = sapply(extra, function(x) paste(read.fwf(textConnection(x), c(2, nchar(x)), as.is = TRUE), collapse = " chr"))


missing_e = getFN(emb8)[grepl("E", getFN(emb8)$cell), ]
true_e = getKnownAneu(emb8)[grepl("E", getKnownAneu(emb8)$cell), ]

tab_true = table(c(true_e$chr, 1:19))-1
tab_missing = table(c(missing_e$chr, 1:19))-1



frac = tab_missing/tab_true
remove = !is.na(frac)

#summary(glm( I(frac[remove]) ~ I(mouse_gpc[remove])))

```

By looking at the false negative predictions we have made (`r missing`), we see that the aneuploidy rich embryo E makes up the vast majority of our false negatives (`r format(sum(grepl("E", missing))/length(missing)*100, digits = 3)`%). This is disproportionately higher than the fraction of real aneuploidies in the dataset that originate from this embryo (`r format(sum(grepl("E", getKnownAneu(emb8)$cell))/nrow(getKnownAneu(emb8))*100, digits = 3)`%)

The chromosomes missed in embryo E do not appear to be driven by increased or reduced numbers of considered genes on these chromosomes, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-ngenes-fracmissed).

```{r plot-ngenes-fracmissed, fig.cap="The number of considered genes per chromosome does not affect calling efficacy. For cells in embryo E, we do not see any relationship between the fraction of False Negative predictions and the number of genes considered on each chromosome."}

enough_counts = rownames(getCPM(emb8))[apply(getCPM(emb8), 1, median) > 50]
mouse_gpc = table(getCHR(emb8)[apply(getCPM(emb8), 1, median) > 50])
mouse_gpc = mouse_gpc[order(as.numeric(names(mouse_gpc)))]

e_counts = getCPM(emb8)
e_counts = e_counts[, grepl("E", colnames(e_counts))]
enough_counts = rownames(e_counts)[apply(e_counts, 1, median) > 50]
keep_genes = apply(e_counts, 1, median) > 50
e_emb_gpc = table(getCHR(emb8)[keep_genes])
e_emb_gpc = e_emb_gpc[order(as.numeric(names(e_emb_gpc)))]



plot(x=as.vector(e_emb_gpc[remove]), y = as.vector(frac[remove]), xlab = "Considered genes per chromosome", ylab = "Fraction of true aneuploidies missed by our method")


mod = glm(frac ~ mouse_gpc, family = "binomial", weights = tab_true)
predo = predict(mod, newdata = data.frame(mouse_gpc = 50:300), type = "response")
points(50:300, predo, col = "darkgrey", type = "l")

```

For the fit shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-ngenes-fracmissed), the number of genes available for aneuploidy prediction did not affect the false negative rate (p=`r format(coefficients(summary(mod))[2,4], digits = 3)`, binomial GLM).

How are these chromosomes escaping our calling method? Below, we show the scores for the false negative predictions in embryo E in Table \@ref(tab:missing-aneu-table).

```{r missing-aneu-table}

missing = presentFN(emb8)

kable(missing[grepl("E", missing$cell),], row.names = FALSE, caption="Cells from embryo E incorrectly identified as normal-ploidy. \"monosomy\" indicates whether the chromosomes were monosomic or trisomic. \"score\" indicates the expression score calculated, and \"p.adj\" the associated p-value. \"sig_p\" and \"sig_score\" indicate whether the p-value and expression score are sufficient for aneuploidy call, respectively. \"dir_correct\" indicates whether the expression deviation matches the real aneuploidy.")

```

From these FN results, we see a mixture of cells with significant and non-significant p-values, but none with a significant score. However, a number of the chromosomes do have scores very close to clearing our threshold.

It is surprising that we see so many missed aneuploidy calls in this embryo in particular. Given that the p-value threshold is often unmet, it may be the case that the high prevalence of aneuploidies in this embryo hampers our ability to detect them. In Figure \@ref(fig:missing-variance) we show the effect of the number of chromosomes called as aneuploid on the estimated MAD across chromosomes in embryo E.

```{r missing-variance, fig.cap="Aneuploidy inflence on MAD. For chromosomes that posess more aneuploidies in embryo E, we routinely identify a higher median absolute deviation in cells from this embryo."}

#Variance of chromosomes + # aneuploidies
emb_e = getScores(emb8)[grepl("E", getScores(emb8)$cell),]
split_chr = split(emb_e, emb_e$chr)

mads = sapply(split_chr, function(x) mad(x$score))
n_aneu = table(factor(getKnownAneu(emb8)$chr[grepl("E", getKnownAneu(emb8)$cell)], levels = 1:19))

ggplot(data = data.frame(mad = mads, n_aneu = as.numeric(n_aneu)), aes(x = n_aneu, y = mad)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Number of aneuploidies in embryo E", y = "MAD across cells") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

```


However, the effect is not seen when we include cells from all Reversine-treated embryos, which is how we assess ploidy in this dataset (Figure \@ref(fig:missing-variance-all))

```{r missing-variance-all, fig.cap="Aneuploidy inflence on MAD. For chromosomes that posess more aneuploidies in embryo E, we do not identify a higher median absolute deviation across all Reversine-treated cells"}

#Variance of chromosomes + # aneuploidies
emb_all = getScores(emb8)
split_chr = split(emb_all, emb_all$chr)

mads = sapply(split_chr, function(x) mad(x$score))
n_aneu = table(factor(getKnownAneu(emb8)$chr[grepl("E", getKnownAneu(emb8)$cell)], levels = 1:19))

ggplot(data = data.frame(mad = mads, n_aneu = as.numeric(n_aneu)), aes(x = n_aneu, y = mad)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Number of aneuploidies in embryo E", y = "MAD across cells") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

```

Aneuploidies affecting the MAD do not therefore provide a satisfying explanation of the behaviour observed.

Now we consider the variance of gene expression across cells. We have first set the expression of all genes on truly aneuploid chromosomes to `NA`. We have then renormalised the cells' expression profiles to CPM counts excluding these chromosomes' genes. Plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:cell-var) is the median-variance relationship for highly expressed genes for cells in Reversine treated embryos.

```{r cell-var,warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Median-variance relationship for embryo E and all other reversine-treated embryos."}

dummy_counts = getCounts(emb8)[,!grepl("[GH]", colnames(getCounts(emb8)))]
known = getKnownAneu(emb8)
for(chr in 1:19){
  for(cell in 1:ncol(getCounts(emb8))){
    if(paste(colnames(dummy_counts)[cell], chr) %in% paste(known$cell, known$chr)){
      genes = which(getCHR(emb8) == chr)
      dummy_counts[genes, cell] = NA
    }
  }
}


#renormalise
dummy_counts = sweep(dummy_counts, 2, colSums(dummy_counts, na.rm = TRUE), "/")*1e6


e_counts = dummy_counts[,grepl("E", colnames(dummy_counts))]
other_counts = dummy_counts[,!grepl("E", colnames(dummy_counts))]
e_med = apply(e_counts, 1, median)
e_var = apply(e_counts, 1, var)
o_med = apply(other_counts, 1, median)
o_var = apply(other_counts, 1, var)

plot_df = data.frame(med = c(e_med, o_med), var = c(e_var, o_var), class = c(rep("E", length(e_med)), rep("A-D", length(o_med))))
ggplot(plot_df, aes (x = med+1, y = var+1, col = factor(class)))+

```

Embryo E does not appear to be markedly more variable in expression than the other Reversine-treated embryos. This is unlikely to be driving our poorer performance.

An alternative explanation could be that embryo E has responded differently to the Reversine treatment to the other embryos. This does not appear to be observed in the PCA in Figure \@ref(fig:gnt-substruct), however. 

We have investigated this further by correlating the CPM averages of embryos for the method-considered genes (again excluding aneuploid gene counts) between all pairwise embryo combinations. The correlation coefficients are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cors-mouse).

```{r cors-mouse, fig.cap="Correlation between mean embryo expression levels. Correlation coefficients with embryo E are not notably lower than for other embryos."}

split_counts = lapply(c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"), function(x) dummy_counts[, grepl(x, colnames(dummy_counts))])
combs = split(t(combn(5,2)), 1:choose(5,2))

cors = sapply(combs, function(x) cor(rowMeans(split_counts[[x[1]]], na.rm = TRUE), 
                                     rowMeans(split_counts[[x[2]]], na.rm = TRUE), 
                                     use = "complete.obs", method = "spearman"))

contains_e = sapply(combs, function(x) 5%in%x)

cor_df = data.frame(cor = cors, is_e = contains_e)

ggplot(cor_df, aes( x= factor(is_e), y = cor)) +
         geom_boxplot() +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "", labels = c("Correlation excludes\nembryo E", "Correlation includes\nembryo E"))+
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Spearman correlation coefficient") +
  theme_bw()

ttest = t.test(cor_df[cor_df$is_e,"cor"], cor_df[!cor_df$is_e,"cor"])
```

Embryo E's correlation coefficients are not lower than the other correlation coefficients (p = `r format(ttest$p.value, digits= 2)`), suggesting the cells in the embryo are behaving like the other embryos' cells.

To investigate whether the failure to detect these aneuploidies in embryo E is likely due to the nature of the data, we have looked at the expression sums (in CPM units) across chromosomes for each cell. Notably, these values are distinct from the $s_{ij}$ that we have used to score aneuploidy as they consider all genes, and do not median normalise. These CPM sums are plotted, centred on 0, in Figure \@ref(fig:expr-sums). We have highlighted False Negative chromosome calls, showing the difference between those who failed to pass the p-value threshold alone, and those that also did not pass the $s_{ij}$ deviation threshold.

Notably, for the chromosomes where we have called false negative results (across all embryos), the CPM sums are visibly closer to those of diploid chromosomes than the true positive called chromosomes. This suggests that our method is not introducing any particularly increased rate of error, but that these chromosomes do not show considerable expression deviations due to their aneuploidies.

```{r expr-sums, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap="Chromosome expression sums broadly reflect aneuploidy calls. Each plot shows the CPM expression sums for one chromosome across cells in the five reversine treated embryos. CPM sums were centred and scaled by chromosome number for readability. Chromosomes are coloured according to the success of our aneuploidy prediction model. Where we do not detect aneuploidies in Embryo E cells, those that failed our p-value threshold show similar expression sums to other non-aneuploid cells."}

**False Positives**

Our false positive results do not appear to have any trend (`r extra`). The aberrant expression profiles of many of these false positives are also seen in the RPKM plot in the G&T-seq paper and in Figure \@ref(fig:expr-sums) above; consequently, these seem largely to derive from the data itself rather than something our method is spuriously generating.

##Application of Patel et al. method

The `inferCNV` method, first presented in a [single-cell paper looking at tumour samples](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6190/1396.long), also leverages single-cell expression data to infer DNA copy-number changes. However, there are some important differences to our method:

* `inferCNV` does not supply any statistic for identifying aneuploidies: rather, it generates graphical output of moving-window scores. This does not provide a satisfying output for the user for rare aneuploidies, since the ploidy state of each cell must be visually assessed. Our method provides a definite output for the user, including calls and confidences (via p-values and chromosome scores).

* `inferCNV` groups cells according to the similarities of their aneuploidy profiles. This is useful in e.g. cancer datasets, where common systematic aberrations are expected across groups of cells, but less so where aneuploidies are expected to occur more stochastically through the data (e.g. the embryos described here). Our method easily identifies aberrations that may be rare in the dataset.

* `inferCNV` runs only on an old version of R, for which it can be hard to find the required packages (unless using the author supplied Docker image). Our method is considerably easier to implement, and has no dependencies.

We have run `inferCNV` on the embryo data described above to highlight the differences: it is not easy to identify all of the aneuploidies that were detected with our method by eye from the `inferCNV` output.

We have used the supplied Docker image to build a container to run `inferCNV`. The commands we have run are found in the folded code below, and the figure output is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:dontrun).

```{r dontrun, fig.cap="inferCNV output from 8-cell stage embryo data. No cells were labelled as control for inferCNV, as aneuploidies were rare and not systematically affecting groups of cells."}

While some aneuploidies are immediately apparent, some are harder to see and may not be identified by visual inspection. There are 50 aneuploidies present in the dataset that should be extracted from the image above.

##Summary
Our method is very effective at calling aneuploidy in this dataset, with high sensitivity (`r format(round(as.numeric(mouse_test["sensitivity"]), 4)*100, nsmall = 2)`%) and low FDR (`r format(round(as.numeric(mouse_test["fdr"]), 4)*100, nsmall = 2)`%) and false positive rate (`r format(round(as.numeric(mouse_test["fpr"]), 4)*100, nsmall = 2)`%).


# Analysis on the HCC38/HCC38-BL cell lines (G&T-seq)

## Substructure identification

Another dataset from the same G&T-seq paper allows us to apply our method to a cancer cell line (HCC38) and an immortalised lymphoblastoid cell line (HCC38-BL). The first two principal components of both datasets are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:hcc-substruct).

```{r hcc-substruct, fig.cap="PCA of HCC38 and HCC38-BL G&T-seq cell lines. PCA was performed using the expression (log-CPM) of genes that qualify for aneuploidy testing. The two cell lines split clearly on the first principal component"}

plotPCA(hcc, col = getGroups(hcc))

```

It is apparent that we should treat each cell line separately - they are well separated by PCA on highly expressed genes. This is quite predictable though - they are very different tissues.

Even within the quite broadly spread HCC38-BL cells (in Figure \@ref(fig:hcc-substruct)), we do not observe substructure when plotted on its own principal components, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hcc-blood-substruct)

```{r hcc-blood-substruct, fig.cap="PCA of HCC38-BL G&T-seq cell line. There does not appear to be any substructure in this set of cells."}

plotPCA(hccbl)

```

## HCC38 copy number derivation

The HCC38 cell line's genome is very heavily rearranged, duplicated, and deleted. As such, there are not two copies of each chromosome present in the cell. Not only is hyperdiploidy rife throughout this cell line, but different parts of different chromosomes are present in different numbers, as visible in [this karyogram](http://web.archive.org/web/20141101014209/http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/~pawefish/BreastCellLineDescriptions/HCC38.html). This poses a severe challenge to our method - we are very far from two copies of each part of each chromosome, and even further from two copies of each gene! For this reason we cannot reasonably expect to extract meaningful results from this set of data, so we have excluded it from the manuscript. However, we have retained some of our exploratory analysis in this document to reinforce the point.

We used the genomic data from the parallel sequencing of these cells to quantify how much of each "normal" chromosome is present in each cell, taking the mean of the ploidy calls across bins on each chromosome (see Methods section of G&T-seq paper for bin information) weighted by the bin length. Notably, this does not account for where genes sit in each bin. 

Chromosomes that have mean copy numbers that are very deviant from the across-cell average could be interpreted as "aneuploid", and this should be reflected transcriptionally and in our calling method. There are a couple of problems, however:

1. We have not selected regions for gene content. An increase in copy number over a chromosome may not therefore represent an increase of gene expression of genes on that chromosome. Effectively, the relationship between copy number and transcriptional output that our method is based on no longer holds

2. Basal copy number is not constant, so our approach of looking for $s_{ij} < 0.8$ or $s_{ij} > 1.2$ (i.e. around the new genomic ratios of 0.5 or 1.5 for a copy number variant arounf diploidy) is not well founded here.

In any case, the distribution of these scores is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cn-distribution)

```{r cn-distribution, fig.cap="Copy number calls for HCC38-BL cell line."}

boxplot(t(cn_base_5), xlab = "CHR", ylab = "Average CN call")

```

We call as our 'ground-truth' those which deviate from the median score for each chromosome by a mean copy number of at least ±1. These are highlighted as red squares in Figure \@ref(fig:call-cn-change).

```{r call-cn-change, fig.cap="Identified aneuploid cells from HCC38-BL cell line. The red highlighted points differ from the median copy-number call for its chromosome by at least 1, and are identified as aneuploid for our method."}

chr_medians = apply(cn_base_5, 1, median)
deviance = sweep(cn_base_5, MARGIN = 1, FUN = "-", STATS = chr_medians)

hits = which(abs(deviance)>=1)

cn_change = data.frame(cell = colnames(deviance)[col(deviance)[hits]],
                       chr = rownames(deviance)[row(deviance)[hits]],
                       stringsAsFactors = F)

cn_change$expr_down = deviance[hits]<0

melt_cn = melt(cn_base_5)
calls = melt_cn[paste(melt_cn$Var2, melt_cn$Var1) %in% 
  paste(cn_change$cell, cn_change$chr), ]

boxplot(melt_cn$value ~ melt_cn$Var1, xlab = "CHR", ylab = "Average CN call")
points(x=calls$Var1, y = calls$value, col = "red", pch = 15, cex = 1.5)

```

Note that due to the considerable genomic differences in the cancer to a normal diploid cell it is highly likely to be unsuitable for our method, its analysis is present in this document only to demonstrate this point.

## Aneuploidy assessment

We now call aneuploidies, and assess our performance over this dataset:

```{r test_hcc}

hcc = doAneu(hcc)
hcc38 = doAneu(hcc38)
hccbl = doAneu(hccbl)


hcc_test = testPerformance(hcc)




#get the scores calculated for all the true aneuploidies
comparison_bl = presentKnown(hccbl)
#get the scores for 'true' hcc38 aneuplopidies
comparison_38 = presentKnown(hcc38)
  

```

**HCC38 results**

Unsurprisingly (for the reasons described above) our method does not perform well at predicting chromosome-level copy number changes in the cancer cell line, whose genome is too heavily altered. This is highlighted in Table \@ref(tab:print-scores-38), which shows the method's results for the red-highlighted chromosomes of Figure \@ref(fig:call-cn-change).

```{r print-scores-38}
kable(comparison_38, row.names = FALSE, caption="Results from aneuploid-calling method on HCC38 cell line \"aneuploidies\". Aneuploidies were detected according to differences in DNA-sequencing copy number calls, but cells are not on average diploid. \"monosomy\" indicates whether the chromosomes were identified as monosomic or trisomic. \"score\" indicates the expression score calculated, and \"p.adj\" the associated p-value. \"sig_p\" and \"sig_score\" indicate whether the p-value and expression score are sufficient for aneuploidy call, respectively. \"dir_correct\" indicates whether the expression deviation matches the real aneuploidy.")
```


**HCC38_BL results**

The HCC38-BL cell line contains four chromosome 11 trisomies, two 16q monosomies, and a 16q trisomy. Only two of the chromosome 11 aberrations have been successfully called (although we have not separated expression by chromosome arm). The results of our method on these chromosomes is shown in Table \@ref(tab:print-scores-bl).

All of the truly aneuploid chromosomes' scores have the correct direction of effect (matching expression change with aneuploidy type), and all of sufficient magnitude to pass our $0.8>s_{ij}$, $s_{ij}>1.2$ threshold; however only two pass our p-value thresholds.

```{r print-scores-bl}
kable(comparison_bl, row.names = FALSE, caption = "Results from aneuploid-calling method on HCC38-BL cell line aneuploidies. Aneuploidies were detected according to differences in DNA-sequencing copy number calls. \"monosomy\" indicates whether the chromosomes were identified as monosomic or trisomic. \"score\" indicates the expression score calculated, and \"p.adj\" the associated p-value. \"sig_p\" and \"sig_score\" indicate whether the p-value and expression score are sufficient for aneuploidy call, respectively. \"dir_correct\" indicates whether the expression deviation matches the real aneuploidy.")
```

It is noteworthy that the poor performance of the method is *not* driven by our parameter choice. Plotted in Figures \@ref(fig:parameter-choice-hcc) and \@ref(fig:parameter-choice-emb) is the F1 score (harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision) for various parameter settings in the HCC38-BL cells and 8-cell embryos respectively - note the lower values of F1 in the HCC38-BL plot across all settings. 

```{r parameter-choice-hcc, fig.cap="The F1 score for our method's performance is shown across parameter settings for the HCC38-BL cell line. For each combination of p-value cutoff (x-axis) and required minimum deviation (y axis, 0.2 corresponds to s<0.8 or s>1.2 for significance) the harmonic mean of sensitivity and specificity is shown. The poor performance of our method is not dependent on parameter settings, as it is low across all combinations."}

```

Parameter choices for our method (p<0.1, $s_{ij}>1.2$ or $s_{ij}<0.8$) were not chosen to maximise fit on the mouse dataset but instead at a conventional value for FDR (0.1) and a value for score deviation to take into account any buffered chromosomes or those with sub 1.5/0.5 values due to chance.

<br>

The poor sensitivity may be driven by two differences between the HCC datasets and the mouse embryo data we have used:

1. The cell line transcriptomic data has a considerably smaller library size, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:libsize-subpops).

```{r libsize-subpops, fig.cap="Cell library sizes. Each point is a cell. Solid lines show the density of library size distributions for each dataset. Dashed vertical lines indicate the means of distributions. Both the HCC38-BL and HCC38 cells have considerably smaller library sizes than the 8-cell embryos."}

legend(x=2.7e6, y = 8e-7, legend = c("HCC38", "HCC38-BL", "Mouse 8 cell"), fill = c("darkgrey", "cornflowerblue", "coral"))

```

2. The variance of a gene's expression for a given mean expression is higher for the HCC cell lines than the mouse embryos - particularly in the HCC38-BL cells. This is displayed in  Figure \@ref(fig:variance-subpops), where the mean and the standard deviation of expression (CPM) are shown for genes in each dataset. We use CPM rather than raw counts because the aneuploidy method also uses CPM. The linear model fit between the log-values of these mean/sd values for each gene is overlaid. Although all data follow a similar gradient, intercepts are different, with the HCC38-BL data in partiular showing higher levels of standard deviation for all values of mean expression (note the log scale, the difference is large). 



```{r variance-subpops, fig.cap="Gene expression variance is higher in the HCC datasets. Each point is a gene, with its mean expression shown on the x-axis, and the standard deviation of its expression on the y-axis. Only genes with a median count above 50 are shown (i.e. those used for aneuploidy assessment). The HCC38 and HCC38-BL cell lines show systematically higher expression variance compared to the 8-cell embryos."}

#compatability for later sections:

bl_sd = bl_sub_sd
bl_mean = bl_sub_mean
```

Given the large magnitude scores but insignificant p-values from our method for the true aneuploidies in the HCC38-BL data, expression variance appears critical - inflated variability increases the score variance, which pushes p-values upward.

Importantly, this relationship is not due to a difference in number of cells - there are `r sum(hcc_meta$line=="HCC38-BL")` cells in the HCC38-BL data and `r sum(emb8_meta$treatment=="Reversine")` cells in the Reversine treated mouse embryos.

Before moving on, it is also worth noting that the summed RPKM scores used in the G&T-seq paper (Figure 2 panel C, note the larger scale and increased number of non-aneuploid outliers) also demonstrate a considerably less 'clean' expression distribution in the HCC data than the mouse embryos. This is in support of the increased variance as shown above, but visible on the chromosome-level as well as the gene-level.

## Simulations

To investigate the effects of these two differences, we simulate count matrices from the well-performing mouse data. We have two approaches to this - either by matching aneuploidy effect sizes from the data, or by setting expression in known aneuploid chromosomes to 1.5 or 0.5 times the normal expression. We simulate from the mouse data in order to ensure we retain characteristics of a single-cell RNAseq dataset (e.g. diversity of gene expression levels)

**When using the data to determine effect sizes, we:**

1. Fit the mean-overdispersion relationship over all genes and cells using a loess regression at the log scale. Overdispersion for each gene $g$ is estimated by 
$$ OD_g = \phi_g = \frac{\sigma_g^2}{\mu_g^2} - \frac{1}{\mu_g} = CV_g^2 - \frac{1}{\mu_g} $$
where $\mu$ indicates the gene's log10 mean count across cells and $\sigma$ indicates the log10 standard deviation of counts.
Here, an overdispersion value of 0 indicates no overdispersion, while a large value indicates large levels of overdispersion. For the loess fit, $\Phi(x)$ returns the fitted value for the overdispersion $\phi$ for mean gene expression $x$.

2. Choose factors by which to change library size and overdispersion. These are denoted $\delta$ and $\zeta$ respectively.

3. Choose a negative binomial distribution mean from which to sample. We generate a new matrix of mean counts for cells $i$ ($i\in 1,...,N$) and genes $g$, $\mathbf{M}$, by considering the observed count $c_{gi}$: 

$$M_{gi} = \begin{cases}
\frac{\sum_i{c_{gi}}}{N} & \text{if normal ploidy}\\
c_{gi} & \text{if aneuploid}
\end{cases}$$

Which is to say that:

  * For normal ploidy cells, we consider the mean $c_{gi}$ per gene across the cells. Sampling of new expression values proceeds around this mean according to the dispersion, and we avoid generating data that is overfitted to the existing dataset. To preserve diversity of library size ($L_i$) for these cells, we also scale $M_{gi}$s per cell (over all $P$ normal ploidy cells) using a term $\lambda_i$:

$$\lambda_i = \frac{P L_i}{\sum_{c=1}^PL_c}$$
which simply scales cell sizes around the mean count.


  * For cells with an aneuploidy, we retain $c_{gi}$ for each cell-gene combination, so that we retain the expression balances for all genes, matching the effect sizes observed in the data. We therefore do not scale for library sizes, i.e.
  
  $$\lambda_i = 1$$ for aneuploid cells.
  
4. Sample new counts $\mathbf{C}$ (for all genes $g$, cells $i$) from a negative binomial distribution for each gene-cell combination for the output simulated count matrix $C_{gi}$, including any changes to dispersion according to $\zeta$ and library size with $\delta$.

$$C_{gi} \sim NB(\mu = \delta \lambda_i M_{gi}, OD = \zeta \Phi(\lambda_i M_{gi}))$$

This provides a framework where:

* library sizes and gene expression levels are modelled from real single-cell data

* library sizes and dispersions can be easily altered

* aneuploidy effects (and the effect on other genes in CPM space) are retained from true aneuploidies in real single-cell data.

**When using the fixed 1.5x or 0.5x effects, we:**

1. Fit the mean-overdispersion relationship over all genes and cells using a loess regression at the log scale. Overdispersion for each gene $g$ is estimated by 
$$ OD_g = \phi_g = \frac{\sigma_g^2}{\mu_g^2} - \frac{1}{\mu_g} = CV_g^2 - \frac{1}{\mu_g} $$
where $\mu$ indicates the gene's log10 mean count across cells and $\sigma$ indicates the log10 standard deviation of counts.
Here, an overdispersion value of 0 indicates no overdispersion, while a large value indicates large levels of overdispersion. For the loess fit, $\Phi(x)$ returns the fitted value for the overdispersion $\phi$ for mean gene expression $x$.

2. Choose factors by which to change library size and overdispersion. These are denoted $\delta$ and $\zeta$ respectively.

3. Choose a negative binomial distribution mean from which to sample. For each gene $g$, we calculate the mean count $\mu_g$ from *all* cells' observed counts.

4. For each gene in each cell, determine whether or not its chromosome is aneuploid. The ploidy state of each gene is recorded with $\alpha$, where:

$$\alpha = \begin{cases}
            1.5 &  \text{if  trisomic},\\
            0.5 &  \text{if  monosomic},\\
            1.0 & \text{if  diploid}.
\end{cases}$$
which simply scales cell sizes after considering the mean count.

5. Sample new counts (for all genes $g$, cells $i$) from a negative binomial distribution for each gene-cell combination for the output simulated count matrix $\mathbf{C}$, including any changes to dispersion according to $\zeta$ and library size with $\delta$. To preserve diversity of library size ($L_i$) for these cells, we also scale $\mu_g$s per cell (over all $N$ cells) using a term $\lambda_i$:

$$\lambda_i = \frac{N L_i}{\sum_{c=1}^NL_c}$$
Sampling means and overdispersions are altered according to $\alpha$:

  $$ C_{gi} \sim NB\left(\mu = \delta \alpha_{gi} \lambda_i \mu_{g}, OD = \zeta \Phi(\alpha_{gi} \lambda_i \mu_{g})\right) $$

This provides a framework where:

* library sizes and gene expression levels are modelled from real single-cell data

* library sizes and dispersions can be easily altered

* aneuploidy effects (and the effect on other genes in CPM space) are fixed for each gene around the altered distribution mean of 0.5 or 1.5 times normal ploidy for monosomies and trisomies respectively.

This is analogous to "inserting" aneuploidies into the data with a large effect size, although we match the aneuploidy frequencies to the real data.

We then apply our method to the new count matrices, scoring performance against the aneuploidies known from DNA-sequencing.

An example of the overdispersion fit is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:OD-fit).

```{r OD-fit, fig.cap="Overdispersion fit. An example of an overdispersion fit across genes is shown. We use the loess trend line, shown in red, to simulate variance in our data dependent on each gene's mean expression."}

emb_fit = get_fit(getCounts(emb8))

plot(x=emb_fit$x, y = emb_fit$y, xlab = "log10 Gene mean expression", ylab = "log10 Gene expression OD")

points(x=seq(from = -2, to = 4, by = 0.1), y = predict(object = emb_fit, newdata = data.frame(x=seq(from = -2, to = 4, by = 0.1))), type = "l", col = "red")


```

We have removed some outlying overdispersions ($log_{10}(OD) < -5$) in order to ensure stability of the fit for highly-expressed genes, which are the most important for our method.

<br>

We used this simulation framework to understand the relatively poorer performance of the HCC38-BL data


###Simulating HCC datasets

First we apply our "data-learnt" effect size approach, matching the characteristics of each dataset in turn. To match the library size differences, we scaled library sizes by the ratio of library size means in each dataset. To match variability, we altered the overdispersion parameter to align most genes in the mean-standard deviation plots below.

Simulations are run ten times, with mean performance metrics shown. Plots of gene mean-variance behaviour are shown from a single simulation.

**Original mouse 8-cell results: **
```{r hcc_downsample_original}

#we need to separate these or it will be confounded by DE between the two cell types.
raw_bl = getCounts(hccbl)

raw_aneu = getCounts(emb8)[, getCellNames(emb8)%in%getKnownAneu(emb8)$cell]
raw_fine = getCounts(emb8)[, !getCellNames(emb8)%in%getKnownAneu(emb8)$cell]

ds_factor_bl = 1/(mean(colSums(getCounts(emb8))) / mean(colSums(raw_bl)))

od_bl = apply(raw_bl, 1, od_est)
od_mouse = apply(getCounts(emb8), 1, od_est)

od_factor_bl = mean(od_bl, na.rm = T)/mean(od_mouse, na.rm = T)

kable(as.data.frame(t(mouse_test)))

```

**Control simulation results: **

```{r hcc-downsample-control, fig.cap="8-cell embryo control simulation (learnt effect size) mean-variance plot. Simulated genes (coral) show similar characteristics to most genes in the true dataset."}

#label
#plot mean-sd
control = get_simulated_counts(dispersion_factor = 0.35, normalise = FALSE)
control_cpm = plot_test(sim_counts = control, real_counts = getCounts(emb8))
#do repeat 10x for stats
control_rep = subsample_repeat_analysis(overdisperse = 0.35, nruns = 10)
kable(as.data.frame(t(apply(control_rep, 2, mean))))
```

The control simulations do not show noticable changes in method performance when compared against the real data.


**HCC38-BL simulation results: **

```{r hcc-downsample-bl, fig.cap="HCC38-BL simulation (learnt effect size) mean-variance plot. Simulated genes (coral) show similar characteristics to most genes in the true dataset."}

#label
#plot mean-sd
ds_learnt_bl = get_simulated_counts(dispersion_factor = 2, downsample_factor = ds_factor_bl, normalise = FALSE)
ds_learnt_bl_cpm = plot_test(real_counts = raw_bl, sim_counts = ds_learnt_bl)
#repeat x10 for stats
hccbl_rep = subsample_repeat_analysis(overdisperse = 2, downsample = ds_factor_bl, nruns = 10)
kable(as.data.frame(t(apply(hccbl_rep, 2, mean))))


```

In this HCC38-BL simulation, the performance of our method is severely compromised compared to the low-variance simulation above. 

We now repeat the process with the large/fixed effect size simulations to demonstrate that these changes in performance are not due to subtle characteristics in the mouse data (e.g. a certain few genes driving the effect).

**Control fixed effect simulation:**

```{r fixed-separated-simulations-control, fig.cap="8-cell embryo control simulation (fixed effect size) mean-variance plot. Simulated genes (coral) show similar characteristics to most genes in the true dataset."}


set.seed(42)

fixed_control = subsample_simulate_aneuploidy(
      counts = getCounts(emb8),
      downsample_frac = 1,
      overdisperse_factor = 0.5,
      gene_map = getGeneTable(emb8),
      known_aneuploidy = getKnownAneu(emb8)
    )

fixed_control_cpm = plot_test(real_counts = getCounts(emb8), sim_counts = fixed_control)

fixed_control_rep = subsample_repeat_analysis_fixed(nruns = 10, overdisperse = 0.5)

kable(as.data.frame(t(apply(fixed_control_rep, 2, mean))))


```

**HCC38-BL fixed effect simulation:**

```{r fixed-separated-simulations-bl, fig.cap="HCC38-BL simulation (fixed effect size) mean-variance plot. Simulated genes (coral) show similar characteristics to most genes in the true dataset."}





fixed_bl = subsample_simulate_aneuploidy(
      counts = getCounts(emb8),
      downsample_frac = ds_factor_bl,
      overdisperse_factor = 2,
      gene_map = getGeneTable(emb8),
      known_aneuploidy = getKnownAneu(emb8)
    )
  
  
fixed_bl_cpm = plot_test(real_counts = raw_bl, sim_counts = fixed_bl)

fixed_bl_rep = subsample_repeat_analysis_fixed(nruns = 10, overdisperse = 2, downsample = ds_factor_bl)


kable(as.data.frame(t(apply(fixed_bl_rep, 2, mean))))

```

While we see good performance under this simulation scheme for both settings, perfect performance is lost with the increase in gene expression variability.

###Separation of library size and overdispersion changes

Now that we have observed the problems from the expression variance above, we can look at each of the library size changes and variability changes in turn. We will focus on the simulations that maintain the 8-cell stage effect sizes here i.e. the "learnt" effect size simulations.

```{r separated_simulation_run}


od_rep = subsample_repeat_analysis(overdisperse = 2, downsample = 1, nruns = 10)

lib_rep = subsample_repeat_analysis(overdisperse = 0.35, downsample = ds_factor_bl, nruns = 10)



```

**Results from real mouse embryo data: **
```{r split_true}
kable(as.data.frame(t(mouse_test)))
```

**Results from control simulation**
```{r print_control_learnt}
kable(as.data.frame(t(apply(control_rep, 2, mean))))
```

**Results from library size change**
```{r split_lib_learnt}

kable(as.data.frame(t(apply(lib_rep, 2, mean))))
```

Library size changes alone appear to have very little effect

**Results from overdispersion change**

```{r split_od_learnt}


kable(as.data.frame(t(apply(od_rep, 2, mean))))

```

Overdispersion appears to be the factor that strongly affects the efficacy of our method.

##Summary

Compared to the excellent performance on the mouse 8-cell stage embryos, we see both compromised sensitivity and false positive calling rates in the HCC38-BL data. Despite this, it was seen that the scores of the truly aneuploid scores were still extreme.

Observing that the gene expression variance in these HCC38-BL cells was increased, we have demonstrated via simulations that an increased expression variance degrades the performance of the method, which accounts for the poor performance of the method on the HCC38-BL cells. This also makes sense intuitively, as additional expression variability that is independent from the true ploidy status of a chromosome will compromise the method's performance.

# Analysis on Trisomy 21 neuron cells (G&T-seq)

This is the final G&T-seq dataset produced in the Macaulay et al. paper. First, we will look for the expected T21/non-T21 substructure implicit in the experimental design, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:t21-substructure).

```{r t21-substructure, fig.cap = "Principal components of T21 G&T cells. The first two principal components, based on the expression of genes used for aneuploidy calling, are shown for the cells in the Trisomy 21 neuron dataset. The T21/normal ploidy cells do not split clearly on PC1, though neither are they fully mixed."}

plotPCA(t21, col = getGroups(t21))


```

There is PC1 separation by T21 status, but there is also some mixing between the cell types.

Now, we can see if the expression mean-SD relationship will present the same problems in this dataset as in the HCC data. The relationship is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:t21-split)


```{r t21-split, fig.cap="Gene expression variance is very high in the T21 neuron dataset. Each point is a gene, with its mean expression shown on the x-axis, and the standard deviation of its expression on the y-axis. Only genes with a median count above 50 are shown (i.e. those used for aneuploidy assessment). The Trisomy 21 and control neuron cell lines show systematically higher expression variance compared to the 8-cell embryos, at approximately the same or higher variance as the HCC38-BL cell line."}

test_median = 50

tris21 = getCPM(splitCellsByGroup(t21)[["T21"]])
norm = getCPM(splitCellsByGroup(t21)[["Diploid"]])

t21_highexp = tris21[apply(tris21, 1, median)>test_median, ]
norm_highexp = norm[apply(norm, 1, median)>test_median, ]

t21_mean = apply(t21_highexp, 1, mean)
t21_sd = apply(t21_highexp, 1, sd)
norm_mean = apply(norm_highexp, 1, mean)
norm_sd = apply(norm_highexp, 1, sd)

t21_lm = lm(log10(t21_sd) ~ log10(t21_mean))
norm_lm = lm(log10(norm_sd) ~ log10(norm_mean))

sample_size = 1000
t21_sample = sample(length(t21_mean), sample_size)
norm_sample = sample(length(norm_mean), sample_size)
rev_sample = sample(length(rev_sub_mean), sample_size)
con_sample = sample(length(con_sub_mean), sample_size)


plot_df = data.frame(mean = c(t21_mean[t21_sample], norm_mean[norm_sample], rev_sub_mean[rev_sample], con_sub_mean[con_sample]),
                     sd = c(t21_sd[t21_sample], norm_sd[norm_sample], rev_sub_sd[rev_sample], con_sub_sd[con_sample]),
                     data = c(rep("T21", sample_size), 
                              rep("Diploid21", sample_size), 
                              rep("Reversine embryos", sample_size), 
                              rep("Control embryos", sample_size) ))

plot_df = plot_df[sample(nrow(plot_df), nrow(plot_df), replace = FALSE),]

mod_df = t(sapply(list(t21_lm, norm_lm, rev_lm, con_lm), coef))
rownames(mod_df) = c("T21", "Diploid21", "Reversine embryos", "Control embryos")
colnames(mod_df) = c("int", "slope")
                     


ggplot(plot_df ,aes (x = mean, y = sd, col = factor(data))) +
  geom_point(size = 0.4) +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10(breaks = c(20, 50, 10^(2:4))) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("T21" = "orchid3", "Diploid21" = "orchid4", "Control embryos" = "cyan", "Reversine embryos" = "cyan3"), name = "") +
  geom_abline(data = as.data.frame(mod_df), aes(slope = slope, intercept = int, col = factor(rownames(mod_df))), lwd = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Expression mean", y = "Expression S.D.")
                     

```

We see a similar mean-variance inflation as the HCC38-BL cells. Additionally, the variance increase is found in both cell types rather than being driven by conflation of two different cell states.

We expect the high levels of variability to prevent our method from working properly, which would result poor performance for this dataset. To test this, we focussed on the Trisomy 21 aneuploidies in these cells.

If we consider all the cells in this dataset together, we will have approximately the same number of chromosome 21 trisomies as normal ploidy cells, which will produce a problem for our method - the median scoring chromosome 21 is not necessarily normal ploidy. We therefore consider all the control cells (`r sum(!tris_meta$tris)`) and a fraction of the Trisomy 21 cells (a ratio of 4 normal : 1 trisomy). We have also included the other aneuploidies visible in the figures 2G and 2H of the G&T-seq paper, using the supplementary data from that figure, and defining as aneuploid those chromosomes with a mean copy number difference of at least ±0.5 from 2 across bins (i.e. CN>2.5 or CN<1.5). This represents a copy number variant of more than half of the chromosome. The vast majority of aneuploidies captured are at integer copy number values.

The efficacy of our method on these aneuploidies is shown in Table \@ref(tab:t21-test)


```{r t21-test}
set.seed(42)
keep = c(which(grepl("Control", getCellNames(t21))), 
         sample(which(grepl("T21", getCellNames(t21))), 
                round(sum(grepl("Control", getCellNames(t21)))/4)))

t21_sub = makeAneu(counts = getCounts(t21)[, keep], 
               genes = getGenes(t21), 
               chrs = getCHR(t21), 
               cellNames = getCellNames(t21)[keep], 
               cellGroups = rep("Together", length(keep)))
t21_sub = setKnownAneu(t21_sub, getKnownAneu(t21)[getKnownAneu(t21)$cell %in% getCellNames(t21_sub),])
t21_sub = doAneu(t21_sub)


kable(as.data.frame(t(testPerformance(t21_sub))), caption = "Method performance on Trisomy 21 and control neurons")


```

Performance is very poor again, as in the HCC38-BL data.

p-values are universally high, though we frequently see high aneuploidy scores, shown in Table \@ref(tab:print-scores-t21).

```{r print-scores-t21}

kable(presentKnown(t21_sub), row.names = FALSE, caption = "Results of our method on the true aneuploidies in Trisomy 21 G&T dataset. \"monosomy\" indicates whether the chromosomes were identified as monosomic or trisomic. \"score\" indicates the expression score calculated, and \"p.adj\" the associated p-value. \"sig_p\" and \"sig_score\" indicate whether the p-value and expression score are sufficient for aneuploidy call, respectively. \"dir_correct\" indicates whether the expression deviation matches the real aneuploidy.")

```

This data has shown a more severe degree of variance than the HCC38-BL data according to our mean-SD plots.The performance is also worse than the HCC38-BL data. This result therefore supports our hypothesis that increased expression variability impacts the performance of our method.

# Analysis on Deng et al. data (F1 intercross scRNA-seq)

A study by [Deng et al.](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6167/193) used CAST $\times$ BL/6 $F_1$ mouse crosses to investigate allele specific expression (ASE) at the single-cell level. We can use the allele-specific reads that have been mapped by the authors to try to estimate where there are aneuploidies - we should see imbalances in expression between all assessable alleles if there is a copy number change. 

We have removed some early stages from the data as they are completely dominated by maternal RNA, and we have also excluded the non-embryonic tissues (liver, cultured fibroblasts).

As far as we are aware, this paper does not cover its QC process once reads are aligned. We therefore consider all cells that were made available in the data accompanying the paper. It is notable that all cells look of reasonably high quality when considering the library sizes and number of genes detected, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:deng-qc)

```{r deng-qc, fig.cap="Deng data QC overview. The library size and number of observed genes is plotted for each cell. There are no outlying cells with vastly smaller library sizes, or a discordant number of detected genes, so we retain all cells for further analysis."}

ggplot(data = data.frame(lib = colSums(getCounts(deng)), ngenes = colSums(getCounts(deng)>0), stage = deng_meta$stage)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lib, y = ngenes, col = stage)) +
  labs(x = "Library Size", y = "Number of detected genes") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_bw()

```

Additionally, the authors had tested the cell-libraries for quality before sequencing.

## Allele specific expression (ASE) data

Plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:get-ratios) is the fraction of total reads that CAST alleles contribute to each chromosome, considering only where reads can be distinguished between the two strains' alleles. The cells are grouped according to their developmental stage, with embryo age increasing along the x axis.

```{r get-ratios, fig.cap = "Allele read fractions. The CAST allele read fractions for each chromosome in each cell are plotted. Chromosomes are grouped by cell stage, with embryo age increasing rightwards. Several points are highlighted in colour: these are described in the text following this Figure."}

#assign colours to points

```

There are four key things to notice in the plot:

1. The maternal bias is still visible in the early stages we have considered, as observed on the left of Figure \@ref(fig:get-ratios). Reads are not entirely saturated by maternal transcripts however, so we will retain all of the plotted stages for analysis. Additionally, we will need to be able to take into account the different baseline ASE imbalances for each stage in our analysis that follows.

2. There are two clearly outlying cells, marked in coral, with one in the 8-cell stage and another in the 16 cell stage. They show respectively a large paternal and maternal bias that we do not think is representative of aneuploidy, as we would not expect aneuploidy to be present in every chromosome of a cell and for such a cell to be viable. Instead, there may be some failure of the cell to correctly activate and balance paternal allelic expression, as suggested in the Supplementary Information of the Deng et al. paper. We will remove these cells from the analysis due to their aberrant allele-specific expression behaviour.

3. There is a set of cells from one embryo only that shows a considerable maternal bias compared to other cells at the same stage. These chromosomes are marked in blue.

4. There are two further embryo-chromosome combinations that show aberrant behaviour, highlighted in the Deng et al. Supplementary Text. These are highlighted in green.

In light of the embryo and stage specific effects, we should not use the raw allele expression fractions for our analysis. Instead, we should correct for stage and embryo driven differences.

Our smallest embryo contains two cells with 19 chromosomes each - 38 allele ratios. We therefore will score every ratio as a deviation from the median allele ratio in each embryo - this should abolish both the early embryo deviation, and the aberrant 8-cell embryo, while not relying on a median of very few ratios. Corrected ratios are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:adjust-ratios-embryo)

```{r adjust-ratios-embryo, fig.cap="Allele read fractions, embryo-bias corrected. The CAST allele read fractions for each chromosome in each cell are plotted, including a correction to center each embryo's median chromosome fraction at 0.5. Chromosomes are grouped by cell stage, with embryo age increasing to the right. Coloured cells are as described above."}

ratios$ratio_adj_emb = NA

for(row in 1:nrow(ratios)){
  sub_ratios = ratios$ratio[ratios$stage == ratios$stage[row] &
                              ratios$embryo == ratios$embryo[row] ]
  sub_median = median(sub_ratios)
  
  ratios$ratio_adj_emb[row] = ratios$ratio[row] - sub_median + 0.5
}



ggplot(ratios, aes( x=new_index, y = ratio_adj_emb)) +
  geom_point(data = ratios[ratios$col=="black",], mapping =aes( x=new_index, y = ratio_adj_emb), alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_point(data = ratios[ratios$col!="black",], mapping =aes( x=new_index, y = ratio_adj_emb), col = ratios[ratios$col!="black","col"]) +
  labs(x = "Index", y = "CAST read fraction (embryo adjusted)") +
  theme_bw()

#now we remove those bad cells
ratios = ratios[!ratios$cell%in%c(highcell, lowcell),]
ratios = ratios[!paste(ratios$cell, ratios$chr) %in% c(danger1, danger2), ]

```

This appears to have corrected embryo biases as planned. We now exclude the two aberrant cells (coral) and the two embryo-chromosome combinations (green) that were highlighted in the Deng et al. Supplementary information.

However, there is one other deviation that we should control for - systematic chromosomal ASE imbalances, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-ratios-chromosome)

```{r plot-ratios-chromosome, fig.cap="CAST allele fraction scores per chromosome. Different chromosomes exhibit systematically different ASE imbalances, perhaps due to imprinting of particular genes."}

boxplot(ratios$ratio_adj_emb ~ ratios$chr, ylim = c(0.4, 0.6), xlab = "CHR", ylab = "CAST read fraction (embryo adjusted)")
abline(h = 0.5, lty = "twodash", col = "darkgrey")

```

We will now adjust these by addition of a constant such that the median CAST fraction for each chromosome is 0.5, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:adjust-ratios-chromosome).

```{r adjust-ratios-chromosome, fig.cap="CAST allele fraction scores per chromosome, with correction. Different chromosomes exhibit systematically different ASE imbalances, perhaps due to imprinting of particular genes. We have adjusted the scores by chromosome such that the median score is 0.5, as seen here."}

ratios$ratio_adj = NA

for(chr in 1:19){
  median_score = median(ratios$ratio_adj_emb[ratios$chr==chr])
  ratios$ratio_adj[ratios$chr==chr] = 0.5 - median_score +
                  ratios$ratio_adj_emb[ratios$chr==chr]
}

boxplot(ratios$ratio_adj ~ ratios$chr, ylim = c(0.4, 0.6), xlab = "CHR", ylab = "CAST read fraction (embryo-CHR adjusted)")
abline(h = 0.5, lty = "twodash", col = "darkgrey")

```

Having acquired a measure of chromosome-wide allelic expression imbalances, we will now pivot towards the application of our method.

First, we look for substructure in the highly expressed genes to identify how we should group the application of our aneuploidy method, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:deng-substructure).

```{r deng-substructure, fig.cap="Principal components of mouse embryonic cells (Deng et al). The first two principal components, calculated from the genes used for aneuploidy calling, are shown for the cells in the Deng et al. dataset. Between PC1 and PC2, all stages have split."}

deng_meta$emb_num = as.character(deng_meta$emb_num)

plotPCA(deng)

```

We should analyse by stage, it seems.

We will now investigate the mean-variance relationship in this data. We have chosen two of the largest cell populations to plot, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:deng-variability). We use two populations to prevent differential gene expression artificially increasing expression variance.

```{r deng-variability, fig.cap="Mean-SD relationship of two populations from Deng et al. data. Both populations show increased variability compared to the G&T-seq 8-cell stage embryos. However, they do not show as variable expression as the HCC38-BL data."}

```

Simulating, we will use the parameters of the largest cell population, again to avoid a mixture of developmental stages artifically increasing the variance. Results from simulations are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:simulations-deng).

**Real 8-cell stage results:**

```{r simulations_deng_control}

kable(as.data.frame(t(mouse_test)))

```

**Deng simulations:**

```{r simulations-deng, fig.cap = "Deng embryo simulation mean-variance plot (learnt effect size). Simulated genes (coral) show similar characteristics to most genes in the true dataset."}
fraction_libsize = mean(colSums(getCounts(deng)))/mean(colSums(getCounts(emb8)))

#demonstate the matching results by plot
deng_test = get_simulated_counts(dispersion_factor = 1.3, downsample_factor = fraction_libsize, normalise = FALSE)
test_cpm = plot_test(sim_counts = deng_test, real_counts = getCounts(deng)[,getCellNames(deng)%in%deng_meta$cell[deng_meta$stage=="midblast"]])

#actually test the differences
deng_rep = subsample_repeat_analysis(overdisperse = 1.3,
                                     downsample = fraction_libsize,
                                     nruns = 10,
                                     grouping = emb8_meta$treatment)

kable(as.data.frame(t(apply(deng_rep, 2, mean))))

```

Performance is noticeably lower than in the 8-cell stage data. However, we will continue with analysis for two reasons:

1. The degree of change is relatively low compared to the HCC38-BL and Trisomy 21 datasets considered above.

2. We do not have ground truth to compare against, and just want to compare the ASE and overall chromosomal expression levels. Our comparisons should tolerate some level of incorrect calling.


##Comparing our detection method to ASE counts

```{r apply_method}

deng = doAneu(deng)

#order ratios and our results the same
ratios$cell = as.character(ratios$cell)
ratios$chr = as.numeric(as.character(ratios$chr))
deng_z = getScores(deng)
deng_z$cell = as.character(deng_z$cell)
deng_z$chr = as.numeric(as.character(deng_z$chr))
deng_z = deng_z[!deng_z$cell%in%c(highcell, lowcell), ]
deng_z = deng_z[!paste(deng_z$cell, deng_z$chr) %in% c(danger1, danger2), ]
deng_z = deng_z[order(deng_z$cell, deng_z$chr), ]
ratios = ratios[order(ratios$cell, ratios$chr), ]


ratios$deviation = ratios$ratio_adj - 0.5


```

In this dataset we are calling aneuploidies at a rate of `r format(nrow(getHits(deng))/nrow(getScores(deng)) * 100, digits = 3)`%. As we do not have proper ground-truth knowledge of aneuploidy in this case (no G&T-seq), we cannot properly assess performance.

Instead, we can relate the strength of ASE deviations from 0.5 to the Z-score our model generates. If we are effective in calling true aneuploidies, our significant calls should show greater ASE deviation.

The relationship between our method's aneuploidy confidence calls and the ASE imbalances in chromosomes is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:deng-plot). Z-scores to the right of the red dashed line indicate Z-score significant hits (after p-value correction), while the values above each box in the plot show the number of chromosomes considered in each Z-score bin.


```{r deng-plot, fig.cap = "ASE imbalances increase with aneuploidy prediction confidence. Allele specific expression biases, normalised to an embryo median, increase as chromosomes are more confidently called as aneuploid. Z-scores to the right of the red dashed line indicate Z-score significant hits after p-value correction. Numbers above boxes indicate the number of chromosomes assigned to each bin."}

```

The greater levels of ASE deviation seen in the high Z-score aneuploidy calls support the success of our method: the orthogonal approaches of total expression balance and allele-expression fractions are in agreement. The coral shaded bins show significantly greater ASE deviation than the grey shaded boxes (p=`r format(p_3a, digits = 2)`; Mann-Whiney U test)

In a similar vein, we would expect monosomies to show greater ASE deviations than trisomies: the remaining allelic ratio is 1:0 for monosomy compared to 1:2 in a trisomy. Indeed, we do also see this in our data, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mono-tris-norm-boxplot).

```{r mono-tris-norm-boxplot, fig.cap = "Chromosomes called as aneuploid show characteristic ASE deviations. Trisomic- and monosomic-called chromosomes show increased embryo-normalised ASE deviations. Particularly, trisomic-called chromosomes show characteristic deviation at 0.16 (which corresponds to a 2:1 allele ratio), while monosomies show deviation at 0.5 (corresponding to the 1:0 allele ratio)."}

Using the Mann-Whitney test, we see that the normal ploidy calls are significantly less deviant than the trisomy (`r format(tris_norm_test$p.value, digits = 3)`) and monosomy (`r format(mono_norm_test$p.value, digits = 3)`) called chromosomes, but that the monosomy and trisomy called chromosomes are not significantly different (`r format(mono_tris_test$p.value, digits = 3)`).

If there were no cellular correction whatsoever for the aneuploidy, and genes were expressed according to their fractional presence in a cell, we would expect ASE deviations of 0.16 for trisomies (0.66 - 0.5) and of ~0.5 for monosomies. We do in fact observe this behaviour: note the density present for trisomy calls at 0.16 and for monosomy calls at 0.5 in Figure \@ref(fig:mono-tris-norm-boxplot). 

Many chromosomes do not show these characteristic deviations, however. There are additional biological effects to consider e.g. RNA turnover takes time, we may identify large CNVs in addition to whole-chromosome aneuploidies, and allelic expression is noisy (not least due to the fewer counts considered). The simulations shown in \@ref(tab:simulations-deng) also show that we anticipate that the noisiness of this data will drive some false calls. 

Notably, it looks like there were no chromosomes with very severe ASE imbalances that were assigned to the normal-ploidy group.

# Analysis on mESC data (F1 intercross scRNA-seq)

In thie section we replicate the findings from the Deng paper in a different dataset, using cultured mESCs. This provides an *in vitro* comparison to the previous *in vivo* section.

The counts data used for this section is available from the paper [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193459091500418X) (Kolodziejczyk et al 2015). We have separately acquired the full ASE counts from the authors.

Treatment and batch separate on the PCA shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mesc-substructure), so we group analysis for our method by treatment-batch status.

```{r mesc-substructure, fig.cap="Principal components of mouse embryonic stem cell dataset. The first two principal components, calculated from the expression of genes used for aneuploidy calling, are shown for the cells in the mESC dataset. PC1 splits treatment, while PC2 separates some batches."}

plotPCA(mesc)
# plotPCA(mesc, col = substr(getGroups(mesc), 1, 3))

```

We also can check to see whether the mean-variance relationship behaves (approximately) like the successful mouse 8-cell embryos (Figure \@ref(fig:mesc-var)), as well as the library sizes (Figure \@ref(fig:mesc-lib)).

```{r mesc-lib, fig.cap="Library sizes for mESC data. mESC libraries are larger than those generated in the 8-cell stage mouse embryo G&T data."}

Variance is higher for a given mean expression than in the 8-cell embryos. We will investigate the degree to which this compromises our calling via simulations. The simulation result is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:simulations-mesc).

**Real 8-cell stage results:**

```{r simulations_mesc_control}

kable(as.data.frame(t(testPerformance(emb8))))

```

**mESC simulations:**

```{r simulations-mesc, fig.cap="mESC simulation mean-variance plot (learnt effect size). Simulated genes (coral) show similar characteristics to most genes in the true dataset."}
fraction_libsize = mean(colSums(getCounts(mesc)))/mean(colSums(getCounts(emb8)))

#demonstate the matching results by plot
mesc_test = get_simulated_counts(dispersion_factor = 1, downsample_factor = fraction_libsize)
test_cpm = plot_test(sim_counts = mesc_test, real_counts = getCounts(mesc))

#actually test the differences
mesc_rep = subsample_repeat_analysis(overdisperse = 1,
                                     downsample = fraction_libsize,
                                     nruns = 10,
                                     grouping = emb8_meta$treatment)

kable(as.data.frame(t(apply(mesc_rep, 2, mean))))

```

Performance degredation is observed, but not as severe as in the Trisomy 21 or HCC38-BL cells. Therefore it makes sense to progress as in the Deng data.

```{r mesc_call}

mesc = doAneu(mesc)

```

##Finding ASE values

Now, in much a similar way to the Deng et al. mouse embryo data, we can look at allele specific expression to try to find signs of aneuploidy. Each cell-chromosome combination is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:get-ase), grouped by batch.

```{r get-ase, fig.cap="mESC allele read fractions. The S129 allele read fractions for each chromosome in each cell are plotted. Chromosomes are grouped by experimental batch. There do no appear to be any systematic biases between the batches."}

mesc_ratio_genes = getGeneTable(mesc)
# mesc_ratio_genes = mesc_ratio_genes[match(mesc_ratio_genes$gene, rownames(mesc_s129)),]

mesc_ratios = score_ase(count1 = mesc_s129, count2 = mesc_bl6, chr_map = mesc_ratio_genes)
mesc_ratios = mesc_ratios[order(mesc_ratios$cell, mesc_ratios$chr),]

mesc_ratios$index = 1:nrow(mesc_ratios)

mesc_ratios$stage = sapply(strsplit(as.character(mesc_ratios$cell), "_"), function(x) paste(x[3], x[4]))

#insert a gap between cell groupings
unq_stage = unique(mesc_ratios$stage)
stage_loc = sapply(mesc_ratios$stage, function(x) which(unq_stage == x))
adjust_multiple = stage_loc-1
shift_size = 300

mesc_ratios$new_index = mesc_ratios$index + stage_loc*shift_size 

cell_split = split(mesc_ratios, mesc_ratios$cell)

meanscores = sapply(cell_split, function(x) mean(x$ratio))


plot(x=mesc_ratios$new_index, y = mesc_ratios$ratio, xlab =  "Index", ylab = "S129 read fraction")


```

We now correct for the chromosomal trends, not observing any large ASE differences between batches. The results are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:chr-bias) and \@ref(fig:chr-fix)

```{r chr-bias, fig.cap = "Chromosome ASE biases in mESC data."}

boxplot(mesc_ratios$ratio ~ mesc_ratios$chr, ylim = c(0.3, 0.7), xlab = "CHR", ylab = "S129 read fraction")
abline(h = 0.5, lty = "twodash", col = "darkgrey")
```

```{r chr-fix, fig.cap = "ASE chromosome bias-corrected values for mESC data"}
mesc_ratios$ratio_adj = NA

for(chr in 1:19){
  median_score = median(mesc_ratios$ratio[mesc_ratios$chr==chr])
  mesc_ratios$ratio_adj[mesc_ratios$chr==chr] = 0.5 - median_score +
                  mesc_ratios$ratio[mesc_ratios$chr==chr]
}

boxplot(mesc_ratios$ratio_adj ~ mesc_ratios$chr, ylim = c(0.3, 0.7), xlab = "CHR", ylab = "S129 read fraction (CHR adjusted)")
abline(h = 0.5, lty = "twodash", col = "darkgrey")

```

Similarly to the Deng data, we do see some strongly ASE-biased chromosomes, which may well be aneuploidies. 

##Comparing our detection method to the ASE counts

Again, our high confidence aneuploidy calls are enriched for ASE-imbalanced chromosomes, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mesc-plot)

```{r mesc-plot, fig.cap="ASE imbalances increase with aneuploidy prediction confidence. Allele specific expression biases, normalised to an embryo median, increase as chromosomes are more confidently called as aneuploid. Z-scores to the right of the red dashed line indicate Z-score significant hits after p-value correction. Numbers above boxes indicate the number of chromosomes assigned to each bin."}

```

And again, like the Deng data, we see particularly increased ASE deviation in the monosomic calls, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mesc-state-boxplot)

```{r mesc-state-boxplot, fig.cap="Chromosomes called as aneuploid show characteristic ASE deviations. Trisomic- and monosomic-called chromosomes show increased embryo-normalised ASE deviations.

```

Generally, the aneuploidies called are evenly distributed over experimental batch and condition (max rate `r format(max(batch_rate)*100, digits = 3)`%, min rate `r format(min(batch_rate)*100, digits = 3)`%, mean rate `r format(mean(batch_rate)*100, digits = 3)`%).

##Correspondence to mESC CHR8 aneuploidies

Chromosomal instability is common in mESCs [after many passages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4060510/), particularly of chromosomes 8 and 11 (though the reference linked focussed on J1 mESCs rather than the G4 mESC's used in the data we are analysing). In our mESC data, where a karyotypically normal cell was used to grow the colonies used for sequencing, we might therefore expect to see increased rates of calling of aneuploidies in chromosomes 8 and 11 as these start to build up over cell cycles.

Indeed, we do see an increased aneuploidy calling rate of chromosome 8 (representing `r format(table(getHits(mesc)$chr)[8]/sum(table(getHits(mesc)$chr)) * 100, digits = 3)`% of all called aneuploidies), though no particularly elevated calling rate in chromosome 11, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mesc-aneu-counts).

```{r mesc-aneu-counts, fig.cap="Aneuploidy distribution. The number of called aneuploidies for each chromosome is shown. Particularly, we have identified many aneuploidies in chromosome 8, which is known to be often lose in mESC cultures."}

monos = as.vector(table(factor(getHits(mesc)$chr[getHits(mesc)$monosomy], levels = 1:19)))
tris = as.vector(table(factor(getHits(mesc)$chr[!getHits(mesc)$monosomy], levels = 1:19)))

count_df = data.frame(chr = rep(1:19, 2), count = c(monos, tris), type = c(rep("mono", 19), rep("tris", 19)))

ggplot(data = count_df, aes(x = chr, y = count, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(mono = "purple", tris = "seagreen4"), labels = c("monosomy", "trisomy"), name = "Aneuploidy type") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:19) +
  theme_bw()

tab_mesc = table(c(getHits(mesc)$chr, 1:19)) - 1
tab_deng = table(c(getHits(deng)$chr, 1:19)) - 1

```

Chromosome 7 also shows elevated rates of calling. This may be due to differing aneuploidy behaviours of different mESC lines.

Importantly, these signatures are not seen in the Deng data (the numbers of aneuploidies called for each chromosome are barely correlated between the two datasets, R=`r cor(tab_mesc, tab_deng, method = "spearman")`, Spearman correlation), suggesting that it is a feature of the mESCs and not simply of mouse genome structure (e.g. number of genes per chromosome affecting our method)


#Testing data suitability for method

Here we present three features of real data that co-vary and lead to poor performance of our method. These are:

1. A residual-based score from the mean-standard deviation expression relationships of a dataset.

2. The number of genes that pass our expression threshold (median CPM > 50) in a dataset.

3. The fraction of zero counts in highly expressed genes (median CPM > 50) in a dataset.

<br>

In addition to the data analysed in the previous sections, we include five additional datasets to provide "standard"" examples for other data types:

1. One of the first UMI datasets, [Zeisel et al.'s](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6226/1138.long) work on mouse brain samples. We consider only the oligodendrocytes to acquire a homogenous population.

2. A dataset of ~4000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells sequenced by 10X Genomics (v2 chemistry), the data for which is available [on their website](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/). We have taken the well defined cluster 2, which contains 612 cells, for the analysis here.

3. A recent UMI dataset ([Tung et al.](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep39921)) generated from iPSCs using a Fluidigm C1 machine for library preparation. This differs from the Zeisel data by providing both transcriptomic reads alongside the UMI-collapsed molecule counts.

4. Cell libraries prepared using [Cel-seq2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0938-8) using a Fluidigm C1 machine (Hashimshony et al.)

5. Embryonic cell libraries prepared with Smart-Seq2 ([Scialdone et al.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7611/abs/nature18633.html))

##Residual approach

We have seen above that large increases to the variance of expression data compromise the method's performance. We therefore want a simple approach to determine whether or not our method is appropriate for a particular dataset, given its variability

We remain focussed on the the mean-standard deviation plots we have shown above, and also continue to use the G&T-seq 8 cell embryos (reversine treated) as a gold standard dataset.

Using the G&T-seq 8-cell dataset (Reversine-treated embryos only), we have fit the linear model across highly expressed (median CPM > 50) genes $i$ ($i \in 1,...,n_{\text{genes}}$):

$$ Y_i = X_i\beta + \epsilon $$

where $Y_i$ is the log10 transform of the standard deviation of gene expression for each gene, and $X_i$ the log10 transform of the mean gene expression for each gene (in both instances only considering genes expressed with a median count higher than 50). 


<!-- From this model we take the expected trend -->

<!-- $$ E[\mathbf{Y}] = \mathbf{X}\beta $$ -->

<!-- and use $\beta$ to estimate G&T-like values of the standard deviation from mean expression values from other datasets, which we indicate with an asterisk -->

<!-- $$ E[\mathbf{Y^*}] = \mathbf{X}^*\beta $$ -->

<!-- Because the underlying variability in our new dataset will be different to that in the 8-cell data, the real data shows systematic differences to these fitted values. -->

<!-- To quantify the overall deviation between the new data and our successful 8-cell stage data, we take the sum of the residuals -->

Given these same quantities ($X^*_j$, $Y^*_j$) from a new dataset, calculated over its highly expressed genes $j \in 1,...,n^*_{\text{genes}}$ , we consider the difference to the 8-cell stage data behaviour as the sum of the "residuals" of the new data to the line fitted on the 8-cell data:

$$ r^* = \sum_{k=1}^{n^*_\text{genes}}\left(Y^*_k - \beta X^*_k \right)$$

and correct for the number of genes, which may vary between datasets

$$s^* = \frac{r^*}{n_{genes}^*}$$

this score $s^*$ represents the overall variability change of a dataset to the 8-cell dataset.

This process is shown schematically in Figure \@ref(fig:residual-schematic). When applied to real data, the line would correspond to the G&T-seq fit, and the points to the genes from a new dataset:

```{r residual-schematic, fig.cap="Gene expression variability schematics. In the upper plot, the genes (data points) are roughly as variable as the trend line. The sum of residuals here will be close to zero, indicating similar variability between the two datasets. In the lower plot, the genes are systematically more variable than the plotted line, so the residual sum will be high. This data is more variable than that of the plotted line."}

multiplot(p1, p2)

```

The score in this toy data is the sum of the lengths in red, less the sum of lengths in blue, divided by the number of genes.

We use this "residual" approach because:

1. It weighs genes equally, as does our aneuploidy detection method

2. It can handle differences in the gradient and intercept of the mean-SD relationship as it operates on a gene-by-gene level

We simulate (using the method from the Section 3) and test a variety of overdispersion parameters.

```

Calculating residual scores from the simulated data, we see that the overdispersion and the residual score vary together, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-od)

```{r plot-od, fig.cap="Overdispersion and the calculated residual score vary together for simulations with increasing variance"}

ggplot(data = data.frame(od = as.numeric(names(resid)), 
                         resid = as.numeric(resid)), 
       mapping = aes(x = od, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Overdispersion", y= "Residual score") +
  theme_bw()


```

As we would expect, the decreased performance of higher overdispersion (shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-od-perf)) is also manifested in the residual scores (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-resid-perf):

```{r plot-od-perf, fig.cap="Aneuploidy detection sensitivity decreases with increasing overdispersion for simulations with increasing variance."}

Previously, we have rougly estimated a suitable overdispersion factor that simulates datasets with similar variability to real data. However, we can now directly calculate residual scores from datasets.

We now show the residual scores we have calculated from datasets overlaid on the performance of our simulations, in Figure \@ref(fig:show-data).

```{r show-data, fig.cap="Residual scores of various datasets. The residual scores, calculated for data used for aneuploidy calling and other data introduced in this section, are shown.

There are a few interesting things to notice in these values:

1. The poorly-performing G&T-seq data show large residual scores, as expected

2. 10X data appears to be unsuitable for this method due to its very large residual score.

3. Collapsing the C1 (Tung et al.) UMI reads into molecule counts reduces the residual score.

4. The most recent protocols and datasets (e.g. Cel-seq2 and Scialdone et al.'s Smart-Seq2 processed embryonic cells) show low residual scores, and therefore appear to be ideal for the application of our method.

As we have shown in previous sections, increased variability results in lower performance of our method.
These residual scores therefore represent a simple and quick test to identify to what degree inflated gene expression deviation in a dataset will adversely affect performance.

To ensure that this residual score is relatively independent of the number of cells being considered, we have randomly downsampled the mESC data, and recalculated the residual scores. The values of ten repeated simulations for each downsampled cell number are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sample-size).

```{r sample-size, fig.cap= "Residual score is weakly dependent on number of cells considered. The residual score has been calculated for mESC data, downsampled to reduced cell number. The residual score is not considerably affected by this downsampling."}

big_resid = getMetrics(mesc)[["residual"]]
resid_50 = sapply(1:10, function(x) getMetrics(sampleCells(mesc, 50))[["residual"]])

points(x = c(50, 100, 200, 400, ncol(getCounts(mesc))), y = resid_means, type = "l", col = "coral")

```

## Number of genes

Residual scores and overdispersion also affect the number of genes that can be considered under our median CPM > 50 cutoff. In Figure \@ref(fig:ngenes-plot), we have plotted the number of genes in our simulations vs. their residual scores as the black line. Additionally, values obtained from real datasets have been overlaid.

```{r ngenes-plot, fig.cap = "Number of genes that quality for aneuploidy detection varies with residual score. For the data considered in this manuscript, an increased level of expression variance (measured by the residual score) is observed alonside a reduction in the number of genes that are used for aneuploidy detection (median expression > 50). For simulated data, increased overdispersion also reduces the number of considered genes.", fig.wide=TRUE}

ngenes_data = sapply(data, function(x) getMetrics(x)[["ngenes"]] )

#then through these lists, get the mean number of genes that pass the threshold
mean_genes = sapply(ploidytests, function(x) mean(sapply(x, function(y) getMetrics(y)$ngenes)))

ngene_df = data.frame(od = od_factors, ngenes = mean_genes, resid = resid)

ggplot(data = ngene_df) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = resid, y = ngenes)) +
  geom_point(data = data.frame(data_resid = data_resids, data_ngenes = ngenes_data, data_name = names(data)), mapping = aes(x = data_resid, y = ngenes_data, col = data_name), size = 3) +
  scale_colour_Publication(labels = data_labels, name = "") +
  annotate("text", 0.45, 3000, label = "Overdispersion simulations") +
  labs(x = "Residual score", y = "Number of genes (median CPM > 50)") +
  theme_bw()
  
# names(ngenes_data) = data_labels[match(names(ngenes_data), names(data_labels))]
# print(ngenes_data)


```

The number of considered genes is an alternative metric for assessing whether our method can be applied reliably. However, it is important to note that the number of highly expressed (median CPM > 50) genes will vary by biology as well as by variability - e.g. embryonic stem cells express more genes at high levels than very specialised, mature cell types.

In terms of the observed results, it is not surprising that the number of expressed genes affects method accuracy - when we consider fewer genes, the method is less robust to noise affecting its score.

##Fraction of zeroes

As data becomes more variable, the number of genes with 0 count will also increase (this is particularly characteristic of data with poor capture efficiency, such as droplet sequencing technologies).

We observe that the datasets that we perform worst on also show an increased number of 0 counts in their highly expressed (median CPM > 50) genes, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:zero-count-boxplot)

```{r zero-count-boxplot, fig.cap="Fraction of zeros in genes used for aneuploidy detection. The most variable datasets considered in our analyses show a much higher fraction of 0 counts for genes used in aneuploidy detection.", fig.wide=TRUE}


data_zeroes = lapply(data, function(x) getMetrics(x)[["zeros"]])

unlisted = unlist(data_zeroes)
split_names = strsplit(names(unlisted), split = ".", fixed = T)

zero_df = data.frame(frac = unlisted, data = sapply(split_names, function(x) x[1]))

data_labels_narrow = c(gt = "G&T 8 cell\nControl",
                       bl = "HCC38-BL",
                       tris_control = "Trisomy\ncontrol",
                       tris_tris = "Trisomy\nT21",
                       mesc = "mESCs",
                       deng_8cell = "Deng\n8 cell",
                       deng_lateblast = "Deng late\nblastocyst",
                       zeisel = "Zeisel\noligodendrocytes",
                       ten = "10X\nPBMCs",
                       gilad_reads = "C1 UMI\nreads",
                       gilad_mols = "C1 UMI\nmolecules",
                       scialdone = "Scialdone\nemb. cells",
                       cel = "Cel-Seq2")

ggplot(zero_df, mapping = aes(y = frac, x = factor(data, ordered = T, levels = names(data_zeroes)[order(sapply(data_zeroes, median))]))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Dataset") +
  ylab("Fraction of zeroes for genes considered") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = data_labels_narrow) +
  theme_bw()

```

It is likely that this plot reflects capture efficiency differences between different datasets. A low capture efficiency will lead to noisier and lower quality data.

## Summary

We have identified three metrics that can be applied to a dataset to understand how well suited it is to our method:

1. A "residual score" to quantify how much more or less variable the expression profile is of the highly expressed (median CPM > 50) genes compared to a dataset that performs well (here, the G&T-seq 8-cell embryos)

2. The number of genes that are considered for analysis in a dataset (median CPM > 50)

3. The fraction of 0 counts that are observed for the genes that qualify for analysis (median CPM > 50)

An increase in the residual score and 0-count fraction, and a decrease in the number of genes considered all correspond to a poorer quality dataset for the purposes of this aneuploidy detection method. This has been demonstrated from real data as well as our overdispersed simulations. 

We advise caution when interpreting results of our method on datasets that score poorly in these metrics.

We have performed differential expression (DE) analyses between aneuploid and normal-ploidy cells in each of the mouse datasets we have analysed (these are those with high-quality aneuploidy calls).

For the G&T-seq 8-cell embryos, we use true ploidy knowledge of each cell for our DE. For the mESCs and Deng et al. embryos we use our method's aneuploidy calls. We have performed DE analysis using edgeR, including genes with a mean CPM expression of at least 10. For the mESC and Deng calls, we want to find a high-confidence set of DE genes; therefore we have only considered genes that are expressed with CPM>10 in *both* datasets.

We have only considered the Reversine treated embryos in the G&T-seq data, as the lack of true aneuploid cells in the Control set prevents construction of a full-rank design matrix. In the mESC data, we use as a covariate the batch-treatment status of each cell, and for the Deng. et al embryos we use the developmental stage (e.g. 16 cell, late blastocyst).

First, we need to show that the DE gene calls do not depend on the number of aneuploidies observed. For example, if we had observed many Trisomy 3 CNVs, we could be concerned that all the genes on chromosome 3 will be differentially expressed, and that we would not be capturing a cellular response to aneuploidy.

In Figure \@ref(fig:multi-de), we have plotted the log fold change for each gene considered for DE analysis alongside the gain or loss in number of chromosome copies across the dataset (i.e. an excess of trisomies provides a positive value). 

```{r multi-de, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="The number of observed aneuploidies does not affect DE calls. Plotted for the Deng and mESC datasets are the log2 fold change values, alongside the total difference in predicted copy number. A high copy number difference indicates a prevalence of trisomies in the data, and a low difference a prevalence of monosomies."}

multiplot(cn_plot_mesc, cn_plot_deng)
dm = lm(mesc_tab$logFC ~ mesc_tab$diff)
dd = lm(deng_tab$logFC ~ deng_tab$diff)

```

We considered whether the copy number difference was having any effect by regressing  the log2(FC) values against the difference to complete normal ploidy (i.e. 2 copies in all cells) for each gene using ordinary least squares.

The copy number difference has no significant effect in the mESC data (p = `r format(summary(dm)$coefficients[2,4], digits = 3)`), though is significant in the Deng data (p = `r format(summary(dd)$coefficients[2,4], digits = 2)`). However, here the coefficient value is extremely small (`r format(coef(dd)[2], digits = 3)` compared to intercept of `r format(coef(dd)[1], digits = 3)`).

One gene is upregulated in the G&T-seq embryos: Snora68, a nucleolar RNA.

We have taken the intersection of up-regulated and down-regulated genes between the mESC and Deng datasets to find a small, high-confidence set of differentially expressed genes.

There are `r length(up_intersect)` up-regulated genes found by this intersection. These are:

`r paste(up_genes[order(up_genes)], collapse = ", ")`.

Of these genes, some are particularly notable:

* **[Gas5](http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Gene/Summary?g=ENSMUSG00000053332;r=1:161034422-161038539)** is a gene associated with growth arrest and apoptosis. Aneuploidy is known to be linked to [apoptosis and cell cycle arrest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663956).

There were `r length(down_intersect)` shared downregulated genes.

Given that many of the differentially expressed genes play a role in aneuploidy response, this finding provides some support for our method's success.

The G&T-seq embryos were treated with Reversine for only 8 hours before library preparation. This could have been too little time for the cells to mount an aneuploidy response, which may explain the low number of DE genes.

##Reproduction of aneuploidy markers

[A recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151134) of aneuploidy in human embryos acquired both genomic information and transcriptomic data (RT-qPCR) from the same cells, and trained a ploidy-state classifier on the genes they had analysed. They reported the following genes to be retained by the classifier:

BUB1, BUB3, CASP2, CDK7, CTNNB1, E2F1, GADD45A, GAPDH, PTTG1, TP53, TSC2 and YBX2. 

Of these, BUB1, CASP2, GAPDH and GADD45A were more highly expressed in aneuploid cells, with the remainder more highly expressed in diploid cells

We have ground truth aneuploidy knowledge in 8-cell mouse embryos (G&T-seq), and our aneuploidy calls in the Deng et al. embryos and mESCs, alongside scRNA-seq data for each of them. We can use our calls toinvestigate the genes highlighted in the study to see if they provide a sound molecular signature for aneuploidy in our murine datasets, or in other scRNA-seq data.

First, we find the orthologous genes in the mouse for those given above.

We have performed differential expression analyses between the aneuploid and normal ploidy cells in the 8-cell G&T-seq embryos (where we have full confidence in ploidy from the genomic sequencing), as well as between our method-called aneuploid cells and all other cells in the Deng et al. mouse embryo data, and the mESC data that we have analysed above. 

In the boxplots in Figures \@ref(fig:boxplot-orthologs-embryo)-\@ref(fig:boxplot-orthologs-mesc), we show the genes that the classifier retained for aneuploidy detection in the human embryo RT-qPCR data, with significantly differentially expressed genes (using edgeR, FDR-corrected p<0.1) highlighted with an asterisk (FDR-correction applied on these genes only). Genes on the left of the vertical line were seen to be upregulated in aneuploid cells, and genes on the right downregulated.

Note that for the embryos, we have excluded the control treatment cells as we cannot formulate a full rank matrix including treatment information, so to include these cells would confound the aneuploid status with treatment-provoked differences. We control for batch in the mESCs and stage in the Deng embryos.

We do not consistently see significance over these genes, though we do typically see the correct changes in directionality. This may be due to a number of reasons:

1. The cellular response between murine and human cells to aneuploidy may be different. Aneuploidy is known to be common in human embryos, but not in mouse embryos. Therefore it is plausible that human development has a more effective mechanism to handle or remove these aneuploid cells.

2. The gene homologs may not function in an identical manner between the species. Therefore our differential expression comparison in this data could be less meaningful than in human data for these genes.

3. We have applied a gene-wise differential expression test compared to a classifier approach. It is not necessary for every term in a classifier to be significantly more highly or lowly expressed individually for it to provide meaningful information.

4. scRNA-seq is not as sensitive as qPCR methods - it is not as well suited to targetting specific genes in this way.

#Cell cycle effects do not influence aneuploidy calling

[Previous work has shown that gene dosage compensation happens very rapidly after gene duplication during S phase](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.03.005). However, we still want to be sure that we are not confounding our calls with cell cycle phase, where there are normal (i.e. non aneuploid) changes in copy number in the genome.

We achieve this by inferring cell cycle phase using a [classifier (cyclone)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202315300098) and looking at how our aneuploidy calls are distributed between these phases, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:infer-cycle).

```{r infer-cycle, fig.cap="Fraction of cells containing a called aneuploid chromosome, by cyclone-inferred cell cycle phase."}


mouse_pairs = readRDS(system.file("exdata", "mouse_cycle_markers.rds", package="scran"))
mesc_cyclone = cyclone(x = getCPM(mesc), pairs = mouse_pairs)

mesc_meta$phase = mesc_cyclone$phases
mesc_meta$aneu = mesc_meta$cell%in%getHits(mesc)$cell

mesc_cycle_tab = table(mesc_meta$aneu, mesc_meta$phase)
mesc_frac = mesc_cycle_tab[2,] / apply(mesc_cycle_tab, 2, sum)

deng_cyclone = cyclone(x = sweep(raw_deng_translated*1e6,
                                 2, 
                                 colSums(raw_deng_translated),
                                 "/"), 
                       pairs = mouse_pairs)

deng_meta$phase = deng_cyclone$phases
deng_meta$aneu = deng_meta$cell %in% getHits(deng)$cell

deng_cycle_tab = table(deng_meta$aneu, deng_meta$phase)
deng_frac = deng_cycle_tab[2,] / apply(deng_cycle_tab, 2, sum)

cycle_df = data.frame(dataset = c(rep("mesc", 3), rep("deng", 3)), phase = c(colnames(deng_cycle_tab), colnames(deng_cycle_tab)), fraction = c(mesc_frac, deng_frac), totcells = c(colSums(mesc_cycle_tab), colSums(deng_cycle_tab)))

ggplot(data = cycle_df, mapping = aes(y = fraction, x = phase, fill = dataset)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Cell Cycle Phase", y = "Fraction aneuploid-called cells") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  theme_bw()

get_pairwise_fishers = function(table){
  combs = combn(1:3, 2)
  list = split(t(combs), 1:3)
  tests = sapply(list, function(x) fisher.test(table[,x])$p.value)
  return(tests)
}

ps = c(get_pairwise_fishers(mesc_cycle_tab), get_pairwise_fishers(deng_cycle_tab))

if(any(p.adjust(ps, method = "fdr")<0.05))
  print("Actually there is a significant p-value")

```

No pairwise Fisher's tests show significant (p<0.05, after FDR-correction) differences between calling rates by cell cycle phases in each dataset. From this, we conclude that cell-cycle stage is not confounding.
